# Account: Sum of Awarded Grants

**Description**

> Calculates total dollars awarded to an Applying Organization in the Outbound Funds package. The rollup uses the Awarded Amount field on Funding Request, so that the total can be shown on the Applying Organization (Account) record.

| Relationship Criteria (SOQL Query) | `outfunds__Recommended_Amount__c > 0 OR outfunds__Awarded_Amount__c > 0` |
| Relationship Criteria Fields       | `outfunds__Recommended_Amount__c, outfunds__Awarded_Amount__c`           |
| Field to Aggregate                 | `outfunds__Awarded_Amount__c`                                            |

**Variations**

- Use the sum of Requested Amount to show how much an organization has applied for, as well as how much theyâ€™ve been awarded (in this case, the SOQL query would be: outfunds**Requested_Amount**c > 0 AND outfunds**Awarded_Amount**c = 0)
- Substitute Applying Organization with Applying Contact to show the same summaries on a Contact record.
